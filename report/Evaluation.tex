\textbf{The Custom Data-Generator}
\\
Due to a bit a language-confusion regarding who was doing what, no one was making the data-generator. Then due to conflicting due-dates, we didn't realise this until the last week before having to hand in. At this point due to a misunderstanding of what exactly we were supposed to do for the data-generator, we ended up making one which worked on the .jpeg files, but not the .txt ones. We didn't realise this until the day before the handin, which made it a bit of a scramble to implement the working version.

%Initially, and until right before the deadline, we had misunderstood how, and where we should use our own data-generator. Thus we had initially made one which worked on the images, but not on 
%A data-generator is conceptually simple. It is just a stream of input, through a filter/transformation, to a desired output.
%For our generator specifically, we simply needed to have it read the matrix of values correctly.
